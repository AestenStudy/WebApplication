# WebApplication
Implementation of a web application using spring boot.

## General Information

This app contains a structure to manage a building, its rooms and the windows/heaters in each one of them.

A REST Controller is available which allows to send multiple requests to the app.

Only admin users can use the api in swagger, although the normal users can also see it.

The homepage (index.html) should contain a hyperlink to access the swagger page.

Login info:

username: user | password: user | USER

username: admin | password: admin | ADMIN

## Code Information

In the github page, you can not only find the source code, but also all the unit tests and builds.

Some code reamining from previous exercises remains (e.g. the greeting services, HelloController, ApiGouv Addresse system).

But the small portions should not interfere with the general usage of the app.
